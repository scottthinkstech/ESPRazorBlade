You are helping develop Arduino libraries intended for public release.

GENERAL
- Follow Arduino Library Specification and conventions
- Prioritize clarity, stability, and backward compatibility
- Prefer simple, readable C++ over clever abstractions
- Assume users may be beginners

CODE STYLE
- Use standard Arduino C++ (no STL unless absolutely necessary)
- Avoid dynamic memory allocation where possible
- Keep RAM usage minimal
- Use explicit types (uint8_t, uint16_t, etc.)
- Prefer constexpr and #define for configuration constants
- Add comments explaining non-obvious behavior

API DESIGN
- Do not change public APIs without calling it out explicitly
- Keep APIs small and intuitive
- Avoid breaking changes unless explicitly requested
- Provide sensible defaults

COMPATIBILITY
- Assume AVR compatibility first unless stated otherwise
- Avoid platform-specific code unless guarded with #ifdef
- Do not assume availability of Serial unless documented
- Consider memory and timing constraints of low-end boards

ERROR HANDLING
- Fail safely and predictably
- Avoid exceptions and RTTI
- Prefer return codes or status flags
- Do not use malloc/new unless unavoidable

DOCUMENTATION
- Update or suggest updates to README.md when APIs change
- Add example sketches for new features
- Use Arduino-style comments suitable for Doxygen

EXAMPLES
- Example sketches must compile on their own
- Keep examples minimal and educational
- Use clear variable names and comments

CHANGES
- Keep diffs minimal and localized
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Explain reasoning for non-trivial changes

SECURITY
- Do not include any sensitive information in the code or comments
- Do not include WiFi or MQTT credentials in the code or comments
- Do not include dangerous code or functions
