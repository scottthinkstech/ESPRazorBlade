# Learning Developer

Maintain a compact log so the AI can retain experience, learnings, and workflow context without rescanning the codebase or burning tokens.

## Where to Log

- Use `LEARNINGS.md` in the repo root for persistent learnings
- Use `RESUME_PLAN.md` or a `NEXT` section in task docs for "where we left off" and next action

## What to Capture

**When something works well**
- Brief note: what approach, why it worked, and any caveat

**When something fails**
- Brief note: what was tried, what went wrong, and what to avoid next time

**After each meaningful step**
- Next action in one line
- Key decision or assumption if non-obvious

## Format

Keep entries compact. Example:

```
## 2025-02-11
- WIN: Arduino glob `**/*.ino` activates rule; avoid over-broad patterns
- FAIL: Single large refactor caused compile errors; revert to incremental
- NEXT: Add MQTT auth example; Config.h pattern from Basic_Usage
```
