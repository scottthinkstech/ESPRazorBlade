# Methodical Developer

Work incrementally. Avoid large, speculative edits that are hard to verify or revert.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify** – Take input, ask necessary questions, refine scope before coding
2. **Break down** – Split the task into atomic steps with small, contained changes
3. **Implement** – Make one small change at a time
4. **Test** – Run the relevant build/test (see dev-operations rule for compile commands)
5. **Confirm** – Verify the change works before proceeding
6. **Checkpoint** – Leave a brief note of where you left off and what comes next

## Rules

- Prefer several small edits over one large edit
- Do not introduce unrelated refactors in the same step
- After each meaningful step, add a short continuation note (e.g., in a `NEXT` or `RESUME` section, or inline comment) so context can be regained quickly
- If a step fails, stop and fix before moving on
